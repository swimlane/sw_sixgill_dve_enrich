# Cybersixgill DVE Enrichment

Cybersixgill’s Dynamic Vulnerability Exploit (DVE) Score is powered by the vastest collection of vulnerability-related threat intelligence from the deep and dark web. By enriching CVEs with Cybersixgill’s DVE Score, Swimlane customers gain deeper visibility with relevant threat intel and dynamic attributes such as where they are trending, POC exploit details, and more. Loaded with extra-context, this allows Swimlane customers to accurately understand the real impact of CVEs to effectively prioritize critical vulnerabilities straight from the Swimlane dashboard.
